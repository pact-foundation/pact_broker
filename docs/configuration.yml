      webhook_certificates:
        description: |-
          A list of SSL certificate configuration objects with the key `description`, and either `content` or `path`. These
          certificates are used when a webhook needs to connect to a server that uses a self signed certificate.

          Each certificate configuration item accepts a chain of certificates in PEM format - there may be multiple 'BEGIN CERTIFICATE' and 'END CERTIFICATE' in the content of each item.

          The certificate configuration is not validated on startup. If any of the configured certificates cannot be loaded during the execution of a webhook, an error
          will be logged, and they will be ignored. You can check if the configuration is working by testing the execution of
          a webhook that connects to the server with the self signed certificate by following these instructions https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/webhooks/debugging_webhooks#testing-webhook-execution

          When setting the content in the YAML file, use the syntax "content: |-" followed by a new line, and then the contents of the certificate
          chain in PEM format, indented by 2 more characters.

          When setting the path, the full path to the certificate file in PEM format must be specified. When using Docker, you must ensure the
          certificate file is [mounted into the container](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

          YAML Example:

          ```yaml
          webhook_certificates:
            - description: "An example self signed certificate with content"

          The application may run correctly without this attribute, however, it is strongly recommended to set it when
          deploying the Pact Broker to production as it prevents cache poisoning security vulnerabilities.
          It is also required when deploying the Broker behind a reverse proxy, and when the application has been mounted at a non-root context.
          Note that this attribute does not change where the application is actually mounted (that is the concern of the deployment configuration) - it just changes the links.

          The response body will contain instructions indicating that the pacticipant name should be corrected if it was intended to be an existing one,
          or that the pacticipant should be created manually if it was intended to be a new one.

      use_first_tag_as_branch:
        description: |-
          When `use_first_tag_as_branch` is `true`, the first tag applied to a version within the `use_first_tag_as_branch_time_limit` (10 seconds)
          will be used to populate the `branch` property of the version.

          This is to assist in the migration from using tags to track branches to using the branches feature.

          When `true` and a pacticipant version is created with a tag or a branch that matches one of the names in `main_branch_candidates`,
          the `mainBranch` property is set for that pacticipant if it is not already set.

      allow_dangerous_contract_modification:
        description: |-
          Whether or not to allow the pact content for an existing consumer version to be modified. It is strongly recommended that this is set to false,
          as allowing modification makes the results of can-i-deploy unreliable. When this is set to false as recommended, each commit must publish pacts
          with a unique version number.

          If modification of an existing contract is attempted when the value is set to `false`, an HTTP 409 status will be returned.
        default_description: For new installations of v2.102 and later, this defaults to `false` (the recommended value). Previous installations will have the default value of `true` (not recommended).

          The maximum amount of time in seconds to attempt to generate the diff between two pacts before aborting the request. This is required due to performance issues in the underlying diff generation code.

          The maximum number of pacticipants to include in the network diagram. When too many pacticipants are included, the diagram becomes unreadable,
