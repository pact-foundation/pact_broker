      The Pact Broker comes with 2 configurable basic auth users - one with read/write privileges, and one with read only privileges.
      The read only credentials should be distributed to the developers for use from development machines, and the read/write credentials
      should be used for CI/CD.

      port:

          The HTTP port that the Pact Broker application will run on. This will only be honoured if you are deploying the Pact Broker using
          a package that actually reads this property (eg. one of the supported Docker images). If you are running the vanilla Ruby application,
          the application will run on the port the server has been configured to run on (eg. `bundle exec rackup -p 9393`)
        default: 9292
      base_url:
        description: |-
          The full URL (including port, if non-standard for the protocol) at which the application will be made available to users.
          This is used to create the links in the API.
          The application may run correctly without this attribute, however, it is strongly recommended to set it when
          deploying the Pact Broker to production as it prevents cache poisoning security vulnerabilities.
          It is also required when deploying the Broker behind a reverse proxy, and when the application has been mounted at a non-root context.
          Note that this attribute does not change where the application is actually mounted (that is the concern of the deployment configuration) - it just changes the links.
        examples:
          - https://pact-broker.mycompany.com

      check_for_potential_duplicate_pacticipant_names:
        description: |-
          When a pact is published, the consumer, provider and consumer version resources are automatically created.

          To prevent a pacticipant (consumer or provider) being created multiple times with slightly different name variants
          (eg. FooBar/foo-bar/foo bar/Foo Bar Service), a check is performed to determine if a new pacticipant name is likely to be a duplicate
          of any existing applications. If it is deemed similar enough to an existing name, a 409 will be returned.

          The response body will contain instructions indicating that the pacticipant name should be corrected if it was intended to be an existing one,
          or that the pacticipant should be created manually if it was intended to be a new one.

          To turn this feature off, set `check_for_potential_duplicate_pacticipant_names` to `false`, and make sure everyone is very careful with their naming!
          The usefulness of the Broker depends on the integrity of the data, which in turn depends on the correctness of the pacticipant names.
