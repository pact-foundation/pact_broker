# This is a modified version of the Rack::Cascade class from https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/2833813/lib/rack/cascade.rb
# that short circuits the cascade if a response body is provided for a 404/403 response.
# This is to allow the UI and API to be in a cascade, but allows the UI
# to return a 404 page when the route matches, but there is no domain object found.
# If we don't do this, then the 404 from the UI causes an API response to be returned.


# This does not work. Do not use it. Have not yet worked out why.

module Rack
  # Rack::Cascade tries a request on several apps, and returns the
  # first response that is not 404 or 405 (or in a list of configured
  # status codes).  If all applications tried return one of the configured
  # status codes, return the last response.

      # cascading.  Arguments:
      #
      # apps: An enumerable of rack applications.
