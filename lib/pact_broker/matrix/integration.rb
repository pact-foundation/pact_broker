# Represents the integration relationship between a consumer and a provider in the context
# of a matrix or can-i-deploy query.
# If the required flag is set, then one of the pacticipants (consumers) specified in the HTTP query
# requires the provider. It would not be required if a provider was specified, and it had an
# integration with a consumer.
