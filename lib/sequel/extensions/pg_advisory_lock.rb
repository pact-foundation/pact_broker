# Copied with thanks from https://github.com/yuryroot/sequel-pg_advisory_lock/blob/d7509aa/lib/sequel/extensions/pg_advisory_lock.rb
# The reason this is copy/pasted and modified is that I wanted to allow exact duplicate
# locks to be registered because different threads running the same code
# should not cause a Sequel::Error to be raised.
# Also, I wanted it to use Concurrent::Hash for multi-threaded environments.
